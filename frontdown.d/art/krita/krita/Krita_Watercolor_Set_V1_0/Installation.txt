Krita Watercolor Set by Vasco Alexander Basqu√©
----------------------------------------------

Installation:


Copy the brushes folder into your krita user directory.
Copy the paintoppresets folder for the Version of Krita you use into your krita user directory.
Not sure which version you use? Most likely it will be the stable release of Krita (2.7), but you can also see it when you open Krita - Menu - Help - About. 

Note: One Brush (Spots034.gbr) is also in the Modular Brushset; you can overwrite it if you have this set installed; The Set uses the Prefix X9 in the brushnames and should appear at the end of the brushlist. Sort it out by typing X9 in the preset docker (krita 2.8+). There are no subcategories in this set.

Default installation path of the Krita folder:

Linux: /home/username/.kde/share/apps/krita
Windows: C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\.kde\share\apps
